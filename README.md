## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! Please follow these simple rules:

- **File Naming**:
  - Past questions → `COURSECODE_SESSION.pdf` (e.g. `CYS206_24-25.pdf`)
  - Materials → Same convention but place under **Materials/**.
- **Placement**:
  - Ensure files are in the correct _level/session/semester_ folder.
- **Duplicates**:
  - Avoid uploading the same material more than once.
- **Empty Folders**:
  - If you create a new folder, add a `temp_file.txt` so Git tracks it.
